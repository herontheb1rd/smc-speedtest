# Updates
(23/7/11): 
Forgot this existed, so here's some unfinished/in progress stuff that I'm working on:
-The actual Speedtest thing: found a library by taganaka that uses C++. Been tinkering with this for the past month, just need to figure out how to add CURL, OpenSSL, and LibXML. Hopefully it works.
-Server side stuff: Uses PHP and MySQL. Pretty barebones, but it works I guess.

Planned stuff:
-AI: Just a simple regression model :P. I plan to use Scikit-Learn and just put it on Cloud Functions, meaning it'll act like an API endpoint. Still need to figure out how to use it though.
-Database/Backend hosting: Planning to use a LAMP stack on Compute Engine. There's a tutorial by Google. GCS doesn't have a free SQL database, so I'm using this as a database/backend

Stuff that I'm gonna work on for the next week:
-Basic functionality: Buttons, labels, and stuff.
-UI/Design: Fonts and tweaking out the layout.

Cheers.
Heron
